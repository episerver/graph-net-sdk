SHORT DESCRIPTION
    JiraPS is a PowerShell module to interact with Atlassian JIRA via a REST
    API, while maintaining a consistent PowerShell look and feel.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Jira is an issuetracker from Atlassian. JiraPS is a Powershell
    implementation to interact with it's API.
    JiraPS can be used by any user. The Jira server will check if the
    authenticated user has the necessary permissions to perform the action. This
    allows JiraPS to be used by system administrators (eg: to create new Users),
    project administrators (eg: to create new Versions) and users (eg: to create
    or view an issue).

GETTING STARTED
    # Tell the module what is the server's address
    Set-JiraConfigServer -Server "https://jira.server.com"
    
    # Get the user credentials with which to authenticate
    $cred = Get-Credential
    
    # Get the date from the issue "PR-123"
    Get-JiraIssue -Issue "PR-123" -Credential $cred

    JiraPS uses the information provided by `Set-JiraConfigServer` to resolve
    what server to connect to. (`Get-JiraConfigServer` can be used to inspect
    what server is currently being used).
    Every command which needs to authenticate with the server has a parameter
    `-Credential`. JiraPS also allows for creating a session with the server
    with `New-JiraSession`.

DISCOVERING YOUR ENVIRONMENT
    Finding all projects you have access to:

    Get-JiraProject

    Get all issues in a project:

    Get-JiraIssue -Query "project = CS"

    See all available information of an issue:

    Get-JiraIssue "CS-15" | Format-List *

    > The view of an issue is minimized so that a table-view is easier to read.
    > There are a few options to get to see all the properties of an issue. >
    Such as the example above.

EXAMPLES
    1. Creating issues from a CSV file
    Given a CSV file which looks something like this:

    project,summary,description,assignee
    CS,Update Server Config, The config of server "srv1" must be updated, admin
    CS,Delete temporary files,, admin

    Issues can be created for each for the entries above with JiraPS like this:

    Import-CSV "./data.csv" | Foreach { New-JiraIssue -Project $_.project -Summary $_.summary -Description $_.description -Assignee $_.assignee }

    2. Set the "fixVersions" of multiple issues at once

    # Get all versions from the project
    $version = Get-JiraVersion -Project TV |
        # Filter by part of the name
        Where {$_.Name -like "1.3"}
    
    # Get all issues we need
    Get-JiraIssue -Query 'project = TV AND label = "ReadyForRelease' |
        # Update each issue
        Set-JiraIssue -FixVersion $version.Name
